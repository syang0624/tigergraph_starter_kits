CREATE QUERY README(/* Parameters here */) FOR GRAPH LowRankApproximation SYNTAX V2 { 
/* 
The LowRankApproximation Starter Kit factorize a loaded sparse matrix A into two low-rank matrices U and V such that the matrix product of U and the transpose of V can approximate the original sparse matrix A. The U and V are obtained by minimize the Frobenius norm (or the root mean squer error) of A - U*transpose(V) using gradient descent algorithm.
To compute U and V, run the queries below in sequence 
  1. initialization
  2. factorization

To compare the approximated matrix with the original matrix, run the queries below
compare_approximation

To print out the matrices U and V, run print_result

The order of the queries need to be followed to ensure the correctness of the result.
